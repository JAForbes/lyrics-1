Staring at the dollhouse across the valley
the trees wait paitently
I guess they have to be
They talk to me
But I don't listen

Because I'm afraid that you will go
That you'll say no
If you I hope the sun never rose
I'd be more alone than before

Because with you I am more than me
If she said no, what would I do?
I'd rather make the world of glue
Don't say no, don't unpause it.

Sometimes the moon comes through the mist
It's a reminder of all I hide there
Behind thin air

Every morning I lie to myself.
That I'm doing well.
I'm really dreading a future hell.

Where you go.  Where you say no.
If you go, I hope the sun never rose.
I'd be lonelier than before.
Because with you, I am more than me.

If she said no, what would I do?
I'd rather make the world of glue.
Don't say no, don't unpause it.

I guess fear controls me
If she would have gone, she'd be gone
Not every moments dark, theres happy moments
Lets unpause it

We could be so free of fear.
Fear has its reign, year after year after year.
